# Groovy Blackjack
Aaron Kaka's first Groovy script, a command-line Blackjack simulator.

When you are at a real casino, and you receive a 2 and Ace, the dealer
will say "Three or Thirteen". This is only the illusion of choice.
Only when you introduce enough card values to put you over 21 is the Ace
adjusted down to a value of 1.
